Magic: The Gathering Commander support tool.

This is a Windows-only executable.
Python installation is NOT required.

How to run:
- Double-click CommanderTool.exe
- If Windows SmartScreen appears:
  "More info" -> "Run anyway"

How to use:
1. Prepare a deck list file (.txt).
   You can generate it by exporting from Hareruya (Export → Magic Online)
   or from Moxfield (Export → Plain Text).

2. In CommanderTool, generate card images from the deck list (.txt).

3. After generation, right-click a card in the card list and select
   the image that matches the artwork you are using.

macOS Notes (Important):
- When running the macOS version for the first time, macOS may ask for
  permission to access the Camera, Desktop, Documents, or Downloads folders.
- Please click "OK" or "Allow" for these permission dialogs.
- These permissions are required for camera-based card recognition
  and for loading deck files and related resources.
